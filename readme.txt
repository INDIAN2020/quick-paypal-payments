== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the labels and captions? =
Go to your plugin list and scroll down until you see 'Quick Paypal Payments' and click on 'Settings'.

= What's the shortcode? =
[qpp]

= How do I change the colours? =
Edit the 'quick-paypal-payment-styles.css' or use the custom styles option.

= Can I have more than one payment form on a page? =
No. When you submit the form a function processes the payment info. If you have more than one form it won't know which one to process. I am working on this options but it's proving to be a bit dificult.

= It's all gone wrong! =
If it all goes wrong, just reinstall the plugin and start again. If you need help then [contact me](http://aerin.co.uk/contact-me/).
